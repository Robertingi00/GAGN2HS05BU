#### Client
    A Country Bus Company owns a number of busses. Each bus is allocated to a
    particular route, although some routes may have several busses. Each route passes
    through a number of towns. One or more drivers are allocated to each stage of a
    route, which corresponds to a journey through some or all the towns on a route.
    Some of the towns have a garage where busses are kept and each of the busses are
    identified by the registration number and can carry different numbers of passengers,
    since the vehicles vary in size and can be single or double-decked. Each route is
    identified by a route number and information is available on the average number of
    passengers carried per day for each route. Drivers have an employee number, name,
    address, and sometimes a telephone number.
